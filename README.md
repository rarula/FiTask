## Features

### Assign tasks to files
Have you ever had trouble with a task whose purpose is unclear?  
FiTask assigns tasks directly to files, so the purpose is clear and the content is naturally detailed.

### Customizable task templates
For most tasks, the same form of task is created over and over again.  
FiTask allows you to define customizable templates to easily create such canned format tasks.

### Archiving and deleting tasks
Completed or no longer needed tasks can be archived or deleted.  
Archived tasks are stored in a dedicated directory and can be opened from the file to which they were assigned.
